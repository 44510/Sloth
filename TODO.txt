TODO for Sloth 3.0
    * Spin off Lsof task and parsing into separate class, document the parsing and data structure produced
    * Show full command (ala ps -ef) in Info Window
    * Move over to object-oriented model for items, lazy-load expensive properties such as bundle identifier, PSN, etc.
    * Highlight matching part of string when filtering (option in filter field popup)
