TODO list for Sloth 2.8

    DONE * Update Sparkle to Mojave Dark Mode-compatible build
    DONE * No longer shows hidden volumes (e.g. "/private/var/vm"") in Volumes filter
    DONE * Fixed issue with mangled process names
    * Show which processes are connected via pipes & unix sockets
    * Add parent process IDs and file inode numbers
    * pipe: FD unavailable handling
    * Fix alignment of top filter controls
    * Filter by device info, not just using mount path prefix (should be faster)
    * Spin off Lsof task and parsing into separate class, document the parsing and datastructure produced
