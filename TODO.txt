    DONE * Update Sparkle to Mojave Dark Mode-compatible build
    DONE * No longer shows hidden volumes (e.g. "/private/var/vm"") in Volumes filter
    DONE * Fixed issue with mangled process names
    DONE * Fixed alignment of top filter controls
    * Build mechanism should default to not code-signing
    * Cmd-L menu item to show selected item
    * Show which processes are connected via pipes & unix domain sockets
    * Add parent process IDs and file inode numbers
    * pipe: FD unavailable handling
    * Filter by device info, not just using mount path prefix (should be faster)
    * Spin off Lsof task and parsing into separate class, document the parsing and data structure produced
