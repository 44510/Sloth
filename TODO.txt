TODO for Sloth 3.0
    * Spin off Lsof task and parsing into separate class, document the parsing and data structure produced
    * Show full command (ala ps -ef) in Info Window
    * Make main controller slimmer
        * Move over to object-oriented model for items, lazy-load expensive properties such as bundle identifier, PSN, etc.
        * Highlight matching part of string when filtering (option in filter field popup)
    * Smart copying (tab-indent subfile names if process + subfiles selected)
    * Show raw IP numbers briefly before IP socket DNS lookup, which can be expensive
    * Process name shown under "Used by" should use Mac-friendly process name if enabled and available (see third screenshot)
    * File System in Info Panel should show name of volume and mount point, in addition to device ID and inode id
    * Store authentication privileges and use them to run command line tool   /usr/bin/file"
    * Why is Move to Trash available for sockets?
